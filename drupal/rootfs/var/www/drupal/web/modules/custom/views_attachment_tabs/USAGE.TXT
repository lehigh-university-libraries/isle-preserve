USAGE NOTES

This module is designed to allow you to use views attachments to create multiple displays for a single configuration. For instance it could be used to create a browse interface that allows user to select between “Grid” and “List” views.

Steps:

- Create and configure a view. We'll call this the Main view.
- Create an attachment view.
- Change the Format of your attachment to create your alternative display.  IMPORTANT: Make sure to apply the format change to this attachment view only.
- Under “Attachment Settings” attach the view to your Main view.
- Ensure that inherit contextual filters and inherit exposed filters are set to “Yes”
- Set attachment position to "after" (though "before" should work).
- Add additional attachment displays as required
- On the Main view set the Format to “Attachment Parent”. Note that the attachment parent is a pseudo-display which defers the actual presentation to your attachments (see below)
- Under Format settings, select your default attachment view. This is how you determine your initial presentation for this view.
- If you want to create a UI for users to select a display, change the  Advanced > Use Attachment Tabs setting to “Yes”

Optional configuration:

- Works with AJAX views (Advanced > Use Ajax : Yes), which will add a responsiveness to your browser
- Not tested with caching (yet)
- Also works with the Better Exposed Filters, Exposed Filter Blocks, and the Facet module for exposed facets (see below)


NOTE ON SEARCH API / FACET MODULE INTEGRATION

Additional implementation notes for those integrating your view with the Search API / Facet / SOLR modules.

There is a known issue that prevents Search parameters from being applied to views attachments, which breaks the core functionality of this module. The development communities have been working to resolve this issue.

A resolution has been posted to this thread, though it requires additional patches and configs: https://www.drupal.org/project/facets/issues/3116236

Steps:

- Apply this patch. https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2022-12-12/facets-attachments-3116236-16.patch
  - Note that the above patch should also work for Facets 2, though it's targeting Facets 3
  - Additional note: This patch may not be required in future versions of Facets
- Under Admin > Views > Settings > Advanced select “Facets display extender” (and “Attachment tab display extender”)
- Configure your main view as normal, filtering by your content datasource and exposing any required filters
- Under each attachment source, look for “Facet Settings” and assign each to the same content datasource as your Main view
